### Currying in Javscript

Currying is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.

Instead of taking all arguments at once, the curried function takes the first argument, returns a new function that takes the next argument, and so on until all arguments are provided. The final function then returns the result.

In simpler terms, currying breaks down a function that takes multiple parameters into a chain of functions that each take one parameter.
